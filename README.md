# AP1000-Core-Generator
Nuclear engineering senior capstone project at The University of Pennsylvania
Spring 2017

The project was divided into three major componets:
  1. Design the fuel pattern (fuelPat) of an AP1000 core using fuel assemblies of various enrichments and burnable absorbers
  2. Run safety caclulations on the designed core
  3. Run operational caclulations on the designed core
  
About half of the semester was devoted to designing the core layout in step 1.

The objective of this repository is to generate all possible core assembly layouts that pass basic criteria of a safe and efficent core.
